## MDDN 242 Project 1: Time-based Media  

### Urban Rhythm Clock

An animated piece which represents time by using a city silhouette 
In this project, I started out with 

Sketch:
I will be making a clock represented by three city building silhouettes, and a large moon behind these. All the buildings will have lights turned on/off, and the amount of lights turned on will be the time for each of the buildings. The 3 buildings represent the month, hour, and minute of the day, the stars will be pulsing according to each second, like a visual metronome. The big moon behind the three city buildings will change according to the months moon phases.

There could be a rotation of sun and clouds and moon and stars, to make the scene not as static. 
Instead of the month, I could do the date of the month. 

Maeda Clock:
I made a clock ticking in an analog clock-like motion. I added my own types of colours and outline of the clock (the outline changes its 
visibility according to the secods).

Original Clock:
I tried to implement my sketch. 

To make it more interesting, should I make the buildings bounce and the moon pulse? I could also code some shooting stars for certian times?
Add santa shooting across sky. Add lamp posts and a ombre sky. Add differently coloured windows on background buildings. 

Changed it to in the AM = theres a sun and clouds.
In the PM = theres a moon and stars. 
For the alarm: there'll be santa on his sleigh riding across the sky. 

In this project, I used an image from Stable Foundation in the lights, and an image <a href="https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/vintage-television-cartoon-icon-illustration_10340616.htm#query=tv%20cartoon%20yellow&position=1&from_view=search&track=ais">by catalyststuff</a> on Freepik. 
I also used some code for some functions.
